Together with his brothers he brought order to the Eastern wilderness, and since their deaths, he is the lone ruler of a great Chiefdom. Yet, this is only the beginning.\n\n#bold One day, Rurik's descendants will found the Kyivan Rus. Or will they? The destiny of this great dynasty rests in your hands.#!"
