	historical_catholic_norse_conversion_decision:0 "Christianise the Norse"
	historical_catholic_norse_conversion_decision_desc:0 "For many years, our people have raided and traded with the nearby western isles and southern continent. These people fight fiercely and fear their singular God, where we do not fear our gods. Does this perhaps mean that the 'Victorious Christ' they speak of holds and grants greater strength? Be it to bow to Christ and His Vicar in Rome, or to simply prevent their clergy from pestering us in our lands, it seems clear that the Cross is the future for our people's faith."

	historical_catholic_westslav_conversion_decision:0 "Christianise the West Slavs"
	historical_catholic_westslav_conversion_decision_desc:0 "For many years, our people have dealt with the Moravians and Franconians in both trade and war. Perhaps it is time for us to forge closer ties to our western neighbours, in return for their recognition of us as an independent and self-determining people. If the highest religious authority of the western world recognises our territory as a sovereign state, our people can only benefit from abandoning the old gods."

	historical_catholic_hungarian_conversion_decision:0 "Christianise the Hungarians"
	historical_catholic_hungarian_conversion_decision_desc:0 "Since our people migrated from the Pontic steppes, now settling here in the Carpathian Basin, we have been exposed to a myriad of foreign faiths and ways of life. However, the might of the western peoples is undeniable, the Christians continue to rule great swathes of bountiful land. Perhaps their rulers are truly blessed by the grace of their God? If so, then the time has come for us to abandon the old ways and strengthen our hold on this Catholic land by embracing their faith so that we may rule by divine right."
